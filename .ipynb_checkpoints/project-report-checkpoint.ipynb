Generally, the only limitation on choosing a state representation is that it should satisfy the Markov property. That leaves us with a lot of different state representations to try from, but are all state representations created equal? No, depending on the function approximator chosen for representing the Q function, the set of state representations that are relatively easy for the function approximator to _comprehend_ shrinks."
