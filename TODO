TODO

create baselines algorithms performance
 - random action
 - static time control action



FUTURE TODO:

- create baselines policies

- create benchmark

- evaluate the two representations on benchmark. 
    - evaluate on multiple metrics
        - critical to look at box plots of performance over all cars (not just mean value)

- optional: create regressor from loop detector data
    - need to have atleast 2 detectors for this, or single bit far from intersection

- create pdf from jupyter notebook


- one interesting thing to see would be how the queue metric reward changes as the green phase is going on.


- incorporate the vehicles inside the network to calculate the travel time metric.
